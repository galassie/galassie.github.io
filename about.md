My name is Enrico Galassi and I'm a software engineer and a technologist enthusiast from Bologna, Italy.

I'm curious, creative, passionate, hard worker, team-oriented and result-driven.
I love to design, analyze, code, listen, talk, learn.

My focus right now is, for the most part, on .NET and web related techologies and frameworks .

I'm also a traveler, snowboarder and a videogamer.
