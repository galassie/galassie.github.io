My name is Enrico Galassi and I'm a software engineer born in Bologna, Italy.

I am currently a full-time Software Developer at [Deltatre](https://www.deltatre.com/) in Torino where I work on cross-platform cloud-based OTT solutions focused on video distribution, identity and subscription based entitlements.

I have experience primarly on .NET technology stack (C#, .NET Core, ASP .NET, Azure) but on my spare time I love to look outside my "comfort zone".

With this blog, I want to share my own experience and thoughts about what I sumbled on during my learning journey.
